					<h3>Hey, {{firstname}}!</h3>
					<p>We're thrilled that you signed up for HackTJ! We have some exciting things planned and it's going to be a ton of fun. We hope you're still able to come, but we understand that plans can change. <strong>To reserve your spot, you need to RSVP with one of the buttons below before Sunday, January 31st.</strong> We have over 100 students on the waitlist, and if you can't make it we'll give your spot to one of them.</p>
